# Radha Gobinda Chandra (RGC: Radio Galaxy Classifier)
RGC is a Radio Galaxy CLassifier named after Radha Govinda Chandra (1878â€“1975), a Bangladeshi-Indian variable star observer from the first half of the twentieth century.

RGC uses convolutional neural networks to classify radio galaxies (galaxies that emit radiation in radio wavelengths). It incorporates the current deep learning models available in astronomical literature.
